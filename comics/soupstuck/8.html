                    <p>Your name is JACK. It's a REASONABLE TEMPERATURE outside for San Antonio in January.
                        You aren't a fan of most VIDEO GAMES. The only few that strike your fancy are MINESWEEPER
                        and HEXCELLS. Unfortunately for your WEEKLY ALLOWANCE, your friends bugged you into buying
                        the LATEST VIRTUAL REALITY GAME. You eventually caved because you CARE DEEPLY for your
                        chums. Fortunately, your father's bank balance is NEARLY ENDLESS. Moving on to things that
                        ACTUALLY interest you -- Music. You love LISTENING TO MUSIC and COLLECTING POSTERS for
                        various BANDS and BAND MEMBERS. You also collect various VINYL RECORDS, though you own no
                        RECORD PLAYER. You also have a STRANGE BOX in the corner of your room, but you let no one
                        see inside.</p>
                    <p>What will you do?</p>
