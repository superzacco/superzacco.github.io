                    <p>The caparacians developed a civilization for themselves. A kingdom ruled over by none other
                        than a black and white king. They haven't changed a bit.</p>
                    <p>The salamanders willingly became part of the working class. The funky little amphibians
                        quite enjoyed providing a backbone for the entire planet.</p>
                    <p>The humans developed and lived off of convenient future technology. There haven't been
                        many gigantic leaps in technological ability, only inventions to make day to day life
                        easier for every species.</p>
                    <p>And finally, the trolls. They have been living along side humans as their co-equals. In
                        an astonishingly un-realistic turnout, everyone voted to see if space racism was good
                        or bad. Everyone decided that it was unanimously a terrible concept.</p>
